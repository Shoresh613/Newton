# Newton
Graphical calculator for Atari

## Graphical Calculator for TOS-compatible systems
Newton is a Graphical calculator with some bells and whistles. It boosts amongst other things xFSL support, FONT-protocoll, Xacc2 and AV-protocoll, COLOR-protocoll, GEMScript, NKCC, it is resizable, copy and paste, MultiTOS D&D protocoll, many functions, variables, constants, rudimentary function plotting etc.

Requirements: All that is really necessary is a TOS compatible OS and a resolution of something like 400*400 pixels. The optimum would be MagiC, NVDI 3 or greater, minimum 4-bit colordepth and a bubblehelp system.

## History

Originally coded by me in C in 1998, then developed off and to for a couple of years. The latest release prior to 2023 was in 2005. Now resurrected for fun, as I discovered it's possible to run Magic PC (Atari emulator) on Android using Termux and Wine.   

## Installation

The latest release is contained in the .lzh archive. The latest build is the newton.app
